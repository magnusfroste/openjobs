## 🎯 Indeed Connectors Explained

### 1. Indeed API Connector (`/connectors/indeed/`)

**Status:** ⚠️ **API is DISCONTINUED by Indeed**

**Why we built it:**
- Indeed Publisher API was historically available
- Good learning exercise
- Code ready if Indeed re-opens API
- May work with ATS integrations later

**Why we're keeping it:**
- ✅ Clean code example
- ✅ Shows API integration pattern
- ✅ May be useful for Indeed ATS partnerships
- ✅ Reference for future connectors

**Can it work?**
- ❌ No - Indeed shut down public API ~2021-2022
- ❌ No way to get Publisher ID anymore
- ⚠️ Demo mode exists but very limited

**Files:**
- `/connectors/indeed/connector.go`
- `/connectors/indeed/README.md`
- `/connectors/indeed/Dockerfile`
- `/cmd/plugin-indeed/main.go`

### 2. Indeed Scraper Connector (`/connectors/indeed-scraper/`)

**Status:** ⚠️ **EXPERIMENTAL - For Learning Only**

**Why we built it:**
- Learn web scraping techniques
- Test if scraping is viable
- Proof of concept for other boards
- Backup when APIs unavailable

**How it works:**
- Uses Colly (Go scraping library)
- Parses HTML from se.indeed.com
- Extracts job data via CSS selectors
- Rate limited (2 seconds between requests)
- Scrapes 5 queries × 3 pages = ~120 jobs

**Should you use it?**
- ✅ For learning/experimentation
- ✅ To understand scraping challenges
- ❌ NOT for production
- ❌ Legal gray area
- ❌ Fragile (HTML changes)

**Files:**
- `/connectors/indeed-scraper/connector.go`
- `/connectors/indeed-scraper/README.md`
- `/connectors/indeed-scraper/Dockerfile`
- `/cmd/plugin-indeed-scraper/main.go`

## 🔍 Key Findings

### Indeed API Research:

1. **Indeed Publisher API is DISCONTINUED** ❌
   - Shut down ~2021-2022
   - No new registrations
   - Existing keys stopped working
   - Documentation removed

2. **Adzuna does NOT cover Sweden** ❌
   - Adzuna aggregates from job boards
   - But doesn't operate in Sweden
   - Can't use EURES/Adzuna to get Indeed jobs

3. **Web scraping is possible but risky** ⚠️
   - Technically works
   - Legal gray area
   - Fragile (HTML changes)
   - Rate limiting required
   - Not recommended for production

## 🎓 What We Learned

### About APIs:
- ✅ Always check if API still exists
- ✅ APIs can be discontinued anytime
- ✅ Have backup plans
- ✅ Document API status

### About Scraping:
- ✅ Technically possible
- ⚠️ Legal considerations important
- ⚠️ Fragile and high maintenance
- ⚠️ Rate limiting critical
- ❌ Not recommended when API exists

### About Job Aggregation:
- ✅ Multiple sources better than one
- ✅ Aggregators (like Adzuna) useful
- ✅ Check geographic coverage
- ✅ Verify data sources
