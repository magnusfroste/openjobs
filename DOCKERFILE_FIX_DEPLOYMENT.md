# Dockerfile Fix - Remove Hardcoded Cron Schedule

**Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Issue:** Plugins syncing every 6 hours instead of once daily at 6 AM  
**Root Cause:** Dockerfile had hardcoded supercronic with `0 */6 * * *` schedule

---

## üîç Problem Summary

### What Was Happening

The Dockerfile had **two scheduling systems running simultaneously**:

1. **Supercronic** (external cron) - Hardcoded to `0 */6 * * *` (every 6 hours)
   - Line 32: `RUN echo "0 */6 * * * curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/sync/manual..."`
   - This was **actually triggering** the syncs

2. **Go Internal Scheduler** - Reads `CRON_SCHEDULE` env var (set to `0 6 * * *`)
   - This was **being ignored** because supercronic triggered first

**Result:** Plugins synced at 08:00, 14:00, 20:00, 02:00 (every 6 hours) instead of once at 06:00.

---

## ‚úÖ Solution

**Removed supercronic entirely** - The Go application has its own robust internal scheduler that:
- Reads `CRON_SCHEDULE` environment variable
- Supports standard cron syntax
- Calls all plugins via HTTP at the specified time
- Logs all sync activity

### Changes Made to Dockerfile

1. **Removed supercronic installation** (lines 21-24)
2. **Removed hardcoded crontab** (line 32)
3. **Removed startup script** (lines 35-47)
4. **Simplified CMD** to run Go app directly

### New Dockerfile Structure

```dockerfile
FROM golang:1.23-alpine AS builder
# ... build steps ...

FROM alpine:latest
RUN apk --no-cache add ca-certificates

WORKDIR /root/
COPY --from=builder /app/openjobs .

# Scheduling handled by Go app's internal scheduler
# Set CRON_SCHEDULE environment variable to control sync frequency

EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["./openjobs"]
```

---

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Commit Changes

```bash
cd /Users/mafr/Code/github/openlazyjobs/OpenJobs
git add Dockerfile
git commit -m "Fix: Remove hardcoded cron, use internal Go scheduler"
git push
```

### 2. Rebuild Container in Easypanel

**Option A: Trigger Rebuild**
- Go to Easypanel ‚Üí OpenJobs app
- Click "Rebuild" or "Redeploy"
- Wait for build to complete

**Option B: Manual Docker Build**
```bash
docker build -t openjobs:latest .
docker push your-registry/openjobs:latest
# Update Easypanel to use new image
```

### 3. Verify Environment Variables

Ensure these are still set in Easypanel:
```bash
USE_HTTP_PLUGINS=true
CRON_SCHEDULE=0 6 * * *
PLUGIN_ARBETSFORMEDLINGEN_URL=http://app_openjobs-arbfrm:8081
PLUGIN_EURES_URL=http://app_openjobs-eures:8082
PLUGIN_REMOTIVE_URL=http://app_openjobs-remotive:8083
PLUGIN_REMOTEOK_URL=http://app_openjobs-remoteok:8084
PLUGIN_INDEED_CHROME_URL=http://app_openjobs-indeed-chrome:8087
PLUGIN_JOOBLE_URL=http://app_openjobs-jooble:8088
```

### 4. Check Logs After Deployment

Look for this message in container logs:
```
‚è∞ Starting job ingestion with cron schedule: 0 6 * * *
‚úÖ Cron scheduler started
üìÖ Examples:
   '0 6 * * *'   - Every day at 6:00 AM
   '0 */6 * * *' - Every 6 hours
   '0 0 * * *'   - Every day at midnight
```

**NOT this:**
```
‚è∞ Starting cron scheduler (job sync every 6 hours)...
```

---

## üéØ Expected Behavior After Fix

### Sync Schedule
- **Once per day at 6:00 AM** (container timezone)
- No more 14:00 or 20:00 syncs

### Logs at 6:00 AM
```
‚è∞ Cron triggered at: 2025-10-25 06:00:00
üîß Running manual job sync for all connectors...
üîå Using HTTP plugin containers (microservices mode)
‚úÖ Arbetsf√∂rmedlingen HTTP sync completed
‚úÖ EURES HTTP sync completed
‚úÖ Remotive HTTP sync completed
‚úÖ RemoteOK HTTP sync completed
‚úÖ Indeed Chrome HTTP sync completed
‚úÖ Jooble HTTP sync completed
‚úÖ All scheduled syncs completed
```

### OpenJobs_Web Dashboard
Next sync times should show:
- Oct 25, 2025, 06:00 (next morning)
- Oct 26, 2025, 06:00 (day after)
- Oct 27, 2025, 06:00 (etc.)

---

## üîß Testing

### Manual Sync Test (Before 6 AM)
```bash
curl -X POST https://app-openjobs.katsu6.easypanel.host/sync/manual
```

This should trigger all plugins immediately and you'll see the sync in the dashboard.

### Wait for Automatic Sync
- Wait until 6:00 AM the next day
- Check OpenJobs_Web dashboard
- Should see all plugins synced at 06:00

---

## üåç Timezone Considerations

### Current Setup
Container likely runs in **UTC timezone**.

**6:00 AM UTC = 8:00 AM CEST (Sweden summer time)**

### If You Want 6 AM Sweden Time

Add to Easypanel environment variables:
```bash
TZ=Europe/Stockholm
CRON_SCHEDULE=0 6 * * *  # Now 6 AM Stockholm time
```

Or adjust cron to UTC equivalent:
```bash
CRON_SCHEDULE=0 4 * * *  # 4 AM UTC = 6 AM CEST
```

---

## üìä Monitoring

### Check Sync History
Go to OpenJobs_Web dashboard ‚Üí Recent Sync History

**Before fix:**
- Syncs at 08:00, 14:00, 20:00, 02:00

**After fix:**
- Syncs only at 06:00 (or 08:00 if UTC)

### Check Container Logs
```bash
# In Easypanel, view logs
# Look for cron trigger messages at 6 AM only
```

---

## üéâ Benefits

### ‚úÖ Cleaner Architecture
- Single scheduling system (Go internal scheduler)
- No external dependencies (supercronic removed)
- Simpler Dockerfile

### ‚úÖ Configurable
- Change schedule via `CRON_SCHEDULE` env var
- No need to rebuild container
- Supports any cron syntax

### ‚úÖ Better Logging
- Go scheduler logs all sync activity
- Easier to debug
- Clear error messages

### ‚úÖ Consistent
- All plugins sync together at same time
- No race conditions
- Predictable behavior

---

## üîÑ Rollback (If Needed)

If something goes wrong, you can rollback to the old Dockerfile:

```bash
git revert HEAD
git push
# Rebuild in Easypanel
```

But the new approach is **cleaner and more maintainable**.

---

## üìù Summary

**What we fixed:**
- ‚ùå Removed hardcoded `0 */6 * * *` cron from Dockerfile
- ‚ùå Removed supercronic dependency
- ‚ùå Removed complex startup script
- ‚úÖ Now uses Go's internal scheduler
- ‚úÖ Respects `CRON_SCHEDULE` environment variable
- ‚úÖ Simpler, cleaner, more maintainable

**Result:**
- Plugins will sync **once per day at 6:00 AM** as intended
- No more unexpected 14:00 and 20:00 syncs
- Schedule is now fully configurable via environment variables

---

**Status:** ‚úÖ Ready to deploy  
**Action Required:** Commit, push, and rebuild OpenJobs container in Easypanel
