## 🌐 Why Chrome vs Colly?

### indeed-scraper (Colly) - Port 8086:
- ❌ **Blocked by Cloudflare** (403 Forbidden)
- ❌ Simple HTTP client
- ❌ No JavaScript execution
- ❌ Obvious bot signature
- ✅ Fast (30 seconds)
- ✅ Low memory

### indeed-chrome (This) - Port 8087:
- ✅ **Bypasses Cloudflare** - Real browser!
- ✅ Executes JavaScript
- ✅ Proper browser fingerprint
- ✅ Passes all bot checks
- ⚠️ Slower (3-5 minutes)
- ⚠️ Higher memory (~200-300 MB)

**Verdict:** Chrome works when Colly fails! 🎉

   ↓
5. Visit individual job pages
   ↓
6. Extract full descriptions
   ↓
7. Store in OpenJobs database
   ↓
8. Rate limit (3 seconds between requests)
```

- TLS fingerprint matters
- JavaScript execution required
- Cookie handling important
- User behavior simulation helps

### 3. Trade-offs Are Real
- **Speed vs Reliability:** Chrome is slower but works
- **Memory vs Success:** Chrome uses more memory but succeeds
- **Complexity vs Results:** Chrome is complex but effective

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate:
1. ✅ Plugin built and running
2. 🔄 Testing with increased timeouts
3. ⏳ Wait for sync to complete

### Short-term:
1. Verify full descriptions extracted
2. Check data quality
3. Monitor success rate
4. Optimize timeouts if needed

### Long-term:
1. Use for production scraping
2. Apply to other boards (The Hub, Academic Work)
3. Consider proxy rotation (if needed)
4. Monitor for HTML changes
